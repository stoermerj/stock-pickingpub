# stock-picking

The goal of this application is to provide users with a stock-picking tool. It:
- lets the user choose one or more stocks to monitor
- lets the user define the price he/she would like to buy the stock at
- lets the user define thresholds (percentage and absolute) he/she would like to buy stocks at
- provides an email for the user if requirements are met

stocks and thresholds can be changed / added in the stock_list.py file.
